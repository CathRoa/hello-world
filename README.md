# hello-world

Hi, I'm new to programming. Since I have the whole summer to do anything,
I decided to make my own game.

My idea is a live-action, turn-based fighting game.
Characters are pre-recorded real people, so it's just like a glorified video player lol.
I want to use Phaser, but I'm not sure how to set it up and what other things I need to download for it to work.
I also want to learn Javascript, specifically how it interacts with web pages... as well as understand event handlers
and how to change the html from the Javascript code.

if there's any tip you can give, I'd be happy to receive them. :))
